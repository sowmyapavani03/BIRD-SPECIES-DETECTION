## üìç Overview

This project focuses on classifying bird images into their respective genera using deep learning techniques. It employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve high accuracy in image recognition tasks. The repository includes scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, as well as utilities for visualizing results. By leveraging TensorFlow and other Python libraries, the project provides a comprehensive approach to tackling image classification challenges in the context of ornithology. The ultimate goal is to aid in the automatic identification and classification of bird species based on visual data.
